                The process of web development can be intimidating at times, but with the right tools and resources, it can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience that enables us to build a site that looks professional. While we absorbed loads of information from our ETECH class, we did make a few mistakes while creating the Netflix-inspired website that we successfully developed. However, because of this, we also learned some important lessons.</h3>
                <h3>
                    We are thrilled that this class has improved our ability to create web pages. Nevertheless, we wanted to be certain that the website we were going to develop would achieve our goals. We opted to search for and learn from various YouTube videos that introduced us to various web designs that became our inspirations. Additionally, the hover effect element is a technique we learned from searching that was not discussed in our lesson but later proved helpful in our web development. The decision to seek out more resources paid off, as we were able to create a website that not only met our goals but also exceeded our expectations. We realized the importance of continuous learning and seeking out added information to improve our skills. Netflix is known for its sleek and straightforward design, and we wanted to incorporate that into our website. We ended up experimenting with different layouts, fonts, and color schemes that matched Netflix. We made sure to display our favorite movies and TV shows that can be watched on Netflix.</h3>
                <h3>
                    Creating a website inspired by Netflix is an exciting project that calls for meticulous diligence, content curation, and a passion for movies and TV shows. It is a rewarding experience that allows us to combine our interests and skills to create something unique and valuable. Taking our ETECH class has been a worthwhile experience that has equipped us with skills that we can apply to various web design projects. It is up to us to use what we have learned to build purposeful, influential websites, and to continue improving as web designers.</h3>
